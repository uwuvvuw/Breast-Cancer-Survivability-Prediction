# Breast-Cancer-Survivability-Prediction
## Introduction to Breast Cancer Survivability Prediction
Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. After skin cancer, breast
cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States,
according to the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, (2022). Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it is far more
common in women. Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has
helped create advances in diagnosing and treating breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates
have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining,
largely due to earlier detection, a new personalised approach to treatment, and a better
understanding of the disease.

Breast cancer can present with various signs and symptoms such as a palpable lump
or thickening in the breast, changes in size, shape, or appearance of the breast, skin changes
like dimpling or redness, inverted nipple, changes to the areola or breast skin, and an
orange-like skin texture. It's important to see a doctor promptly even if you have had a
normal mammogram in case of any such changes. Breast cancer is caused by the abnormal
growth of breast cells which divide rapidly and form a lump. It can start in the milk ducts,
lobules, or other tissue in the breast and can spread to other parts of the body. The risk of
breast cancer can be influenced by hormonal, lifestyle, and environmental factors, but the
exact cause is not known. It is believed to result from a combination of one's genetic makeup
and environment

## Problem Statement
1. Can we use machine learning and deep learning to predict the survivability of breast
cancer patients using the METABRIC dataset?
2. Can deep learning methods improve the prediction accuracy of survivability in breast
cancer patients compared to traditional machine learning algorithms?
3. How can we optimise the hyperparameters of a machine learning or deep learning
model to achieve the best performance in predicting survivability of breast cancer
patients using the METABRIC dataset?

## Objectives
1. Train three models, including two machine learning models and one deep learning
model, to forecast the survivability of breast cancer patients using the METABRIC
dataset.
2. To compare the prediction accuracy of deep learning methods and traditional machine
learning algorithms for the survivability of breast cancer patients.
3. To optimise the hyperparameters of a machine learning or deep learning model for the
best performance in predicting the survivability of breast cancer patients using the
METABRIC dataset
